### ‚ùå CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION

#### 1. JWT Encoding Error (BLOCKING)
**Issue**: Auth service failing to generate JWT tokens  
**Error**: `module 'jwt' has no attribute 'encode'`  
**Impact**: Users cannot register or login successfully  
**Status**: üî¥ CRITICAL - Blocks authentication flow  
**Evidence**: 
- User registration creates account but fails on token generation
- Login attempts fail with "Internal server error"  
- Container logs show consistent JWT encoding errors

#### 2. Missing API Gateway Configuration
**Issue**: Frontend applications cannot connect to backend services  
**Impact**: NextAuth configuration fails, preventing authentication  
**Status**: üî¥ CRITICAL - Blocks user authentication  
**Evidence**:
- NextAuth trying to call `/auth/login` but no route configured
- Frontend expects API routes that don't exist
- Missing reverse proxy configuration

#### 3. Staff Service Not Externally Accessible
**Issue**: Staff service only accessible internally  
**Impact**: Staff frontend cannot connect to backend services  
**Status**: üü° MEDIUM - Limits staff functionality  
**Evidence**:
- Service running on internal port only
- No external port mapping configured

## Conclusion

The MCP system demonstrates a robust and well-architected infrastructure with excellent performance characteristics. The core services are healthy and the applications load successfully. However, critical authentication issues must be resolved before the investor demo.

**System Readiness**: 70% - Infrastructure ready, authentication blocked  
**Estimated Fix Time**: 2-4 hours for critical issues  
**Demo Viability**: Good, pending authentication fixes

The system shows strong potential with its microservices architecture, comprehensive logging, and robust infrastructure. Once the authentication issues are resolved, the platform will be ready for a successful investor demonstration.
