Check frontend container build process\n2. Verify static asset serving (CSS, JS files)\n3. Examine Next.js build output\n4. Test asset paths and routing\n5. Check nginx proxy configuration\n\nThis is blocking user access to your completed work. The frontend shows as unhealthy in docker compose - likely related to CSS build/serve issues.\n\nPRIORITY: Fix CSS loading to restore proper frontend display. All your conversion-optimized design work is currently invisible to users."
