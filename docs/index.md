# Ethical AI Insider Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation portal for the Ethical AI Insider platform. This site provides comprehensive guides and API references for building, deploying, and operating multi-agent workflows.

Use the navigation on the left to explore topics such as getting started, system architecture, and agent development. Each page includes practical examples and best practices inspired by [Anthropic's documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/home).

If you're new to the platform, begin with the [Getting Started](getting-started.md) guide. For in-depth API details, see the [API Reference](api/model-router.md).
