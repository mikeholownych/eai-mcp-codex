# Overview

This project is organised as a collection of small FastAPI services deployed together via Docker Compose or Kubernetes. Each service provides one bounded capability and communicates over HTTP or Redis.

The architecture emphasises clear service boundaries, observability through Prometheus metrics, and straightforward deployment using container images.
