## Database Schema

The system uses PostgreSQL with the following key tables:

### developer_profiles
Stores comprehensive developer agent profiles including capabilities, preferences, and performance metrics.

### team_coordination_plans
Stores team coordination plans with project information, team composition, and coordination strategies.

### task_assignments
Stores individual task assignments with progress tracking, dependencies, and quality metrics.

### conflict_resolution_logs
Stores conflict detection and resolution history with learning data for continuous improvement.

### team_performance_metrics
Stores aggregated team performance metrics for analytics and reporting.

### agent_collaboration_history
Stores historical collaboration data between agents for trust scoring and compatibility analysis.

## Intelligent Features

### 1. Capability-Based Task Assignment
The system analyzes each task's requirements and matches them against agent profiles to find optimal assignments based on:
- Technical skill alignment
- Experience level appropriateness
- Task type preferences
- Current workload and availability
- Historical performance on similar tasks

### 2. Proactive Conflict Detection
The system continuously monitors for potential conflicts:
- **Resource Conflicts**: Multiple agents requiring the same resources
- **Timeline Conflicts**: Overlapping deadlines and dependencies
- **Design Conflicts**: Conflicting architectural decisions
- **Merge Conflicts**: Code integration issues
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Circular or blocked dependencies

### 3. Automated Conflict Resolution
For simple conflicts, the system can automatically resolve issues:
- **Merge Conflicts**: Using semantic analysis and conflict resolution rules
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Reordering tasks and adjusting schedules
- **Resource Conflicts**: Intelligent resource allocation and time-slicing

### 4. Performance Analytics
Comprehensive analytics track team and individual performance:
- Task completion rates and velocity
- Code quality metrics and peer ratings
- Collaboration effectiveness scores
- Workload balance and utilization
- Risk factors and mitigation success

### 5. Learning and Optimization
The system continuously learns from past projects to improve:
- Assignment optimization based on historical success
- Conflict pattern recognition and prevention
- Performance prediction and capacity planning
- Team composition recommendations

## Integration Points

### Existing Collaboration Orchestrator
The Multi-Developer Coordination system extends the existing collaboration orchestrator:
- Inherits session management and consensus building

- Maintains compatibility with existing A2A communication
- Enhances with intelligent task assignment and conflict resolution

### A2A Communication System
Leverages the existing agent-to-agent communication infrastructure:
- Task assignment notifications
- Progress update messages
- Conflict resolution communications
- Consensus building for complex decisions
- Escalation to human oversight when needed

### Git Worktree Manager
Integrates with the Git worktree management system:
- Automatic conflict detection from Git operations
- Branch coordination for parallel development
- Merge conflict resolution automation
- Code review workflow integration

### Model Router
Utilizes the model routing system for AI-powered features:
- Code analysis for conflict detection
- Quality assessment and recommendations
- Natural language processing for task descriptions
- Intelligent suggestions and optimizations

## Usage Examples

### Complete Project Workflow

1. **Create Developer Profiles**
```python
# Register team members with their capabilities
await profile_manager.create_developer_profile(
    agent_id="senior_backend_dev",
    specializations=[DeveloperSpecialization.BACKEND, DeveloperSpecialization.ARCHITECTURE],
    programming_languages=["Python", "Go", "SQL"],
    frameworks=["FastAPI", "PostgreSQL", "Redis"],
    experience_level=ExperienceLevel.SENIOR,
    preferred_tasks=[TaskType.FEATURE_DEVELOPMENT, TaskType.ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN],
    max_concurrent_tasks=4
)
```

2. **Create Team Coordination Plan**
```python
# Set up comprehensive project plan
plan = await orchestrator.create_team_coordination_plan(
    session_id=session_id,
    project_name="E-commerce Platform",
    project_description="Microservices-based e-commerce solution",
    team_lead="senior_backend_dev",
    team_members=["senior_backend_dev", "frontend_specialist", "qa_engineer"],
    tasks=project_tasks,
    deadline=datetime(2024, 3, 15),
    conflict_resolution_strategy=ResolutionStrategy.CONSENSUS
)
```

3. **Monitor and Optimize**
```python
# Continuous monitoring and optimization
conflicts = await orchestrator.detect_and_resolve_conflicts(plan.plan_id)
report = await orchestrator.generate_team_performance_report(plan.plan_id)
suggestions = assignment_engine.suggest_task_optimizations(plan, agent_profiles)
```

### Conflict Resolution Scenario

1. **Automatic Detection**
```python
# System detects merge conflict
conflict = await conflict_resolver.detect_conflict(
    session_id=session_id,
    plan_id=plan_id,
    conflict_description="Git merge conflict in authentication module",
    involved_agents=["dev_1", "dev_2"],
    context={"conflict_files": ["auth.py"], "branches": ["feature-a", "feature-b"]}
)
```

2. **Automated Resolution Attempt**
```python
# Try automated resolution first
resolved = await conflict_resolver.resolve_conflict(conflict.conflict_id)
if not resolved:
    # Escalate to human expertise if needed
    await conflict_resolver._escalate_conflict(conflict)
```

## Performance Considerations

### Scalability
- Database indexing on frequently queried fields (agent_id, plan_id, session_id)
- Redis caching for frequently accessed profiles and plans
- Connection pooling for database operations
- Async/await patterns for non-blocking operations

### Reliability
- Comprehensive error handling and fallback strategies
- Transaction management for critical operations
- Data validation at API and model levels
- Graceful degradation when external services are unavailable

### Monitoring

- Health checks for all system components
- Alert systems for critical failures

## Security Considerations

### Data Protection
- Profile data encryption for sensitive information
- Secure communication channels for agent interactions
- Access control based on agent roles and permissions
- Audit logging for all system operations

### Trust and Verification
- Trust score calculation between agents
- Performance verification through peer review
- Quality gates for critical task completions
- Fraud detection for suspicious agent behavior

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Machine Learning Integration**
   - Predictive analytics for project success
   - Automated code review suggestions
   - Intelligent workload forecasting

2. **Advanced Collaboration Patterns**
   - Pair programming coordination
