# Collaboration Patterns

This guide provides an overview of the collaboration patterns that are supported by the A2A communication system.

## Request-Response

The request-response pattern is a simple collaboration pattern where one agent sends a request to another agent and waits for a response. This pattern is useful for simple interactions, such as asking for information or requesting a service.

## Publish-Subscribe

The publish-subscribe pattern is a more flexible collaboration pattern where one agent publishes a message to a topic, and any interested agents can subscribe to that topic to receive the message. This pattern is useful for broadcasting information to a large number of agents, or for decoupling agents from each other.

## Broadcast

The broadcast pattern is a simple collaboration pattern where one agent sends a message to all other agents. This pattern is useful for sending notifications or for sharing information with all agents.

## Consensus

The consensus pattern is a more complex collaboration pattern where agents work together to reach an agreement on a proposal. This pattern is useful for making important decisions, such as architectural choices or implementation plans.
