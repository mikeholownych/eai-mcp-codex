## ðŸš« Pricing Objections & Responses

### Common Pricing Objections

#### **"It's too expensive"**

However, building enterprise-grade AI infrastructure typically takes 12-18 months and costs $2-5M, plus ongoing maintenance. Our platform gives you the same capabilities in weeks, not months. What's your timeline for delivering AI capabilities?"

#### **"We need a discount"**
**Response**: "I'd be happy to discuss pricing options. We offer volume discounts for annual contracts and strategic discounts for reference customers and partnerships. What specific requirements do you have that would qualify for these discounts?"

#### **"Your competitors are cheaper"**
**Response**: "Price is important, but value is what matters most. Our platform provides enterprise-grade features, comprehensive support, and proven ROI that cheaper alternatives can't match. Let me show you a side-by-side comparison of total cost of ownership."
